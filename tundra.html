<h1>Tundra</h1>
<blockquote cite="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/tundras-explained/">Tundra ecosystems are treeless regions found in the Arctic and on the tops of mountains, where the climate is cold and windy, and rainfall is scant. Tundra lands are covered with snow for much of the year, but summer brings bursts of wildflowers.</blockquote>

<h2>Arctic hare</h2>
<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_hare"> The Arctic hare[2] (Lepus arcticus) is a species of hare highly adapted to living in the Arctic tundra and other icy biomes. The Arctic hare survives with shortened ears and limbs, a small nose, fat that makes up close to 20% of its body, and a thick coat of fur. It usually digs holes in the ground or under the snow to keep warm and to sleep. Arctic hares look like rabbits but have shorter ears, are taller when standing, and, unlike rabbits, can thrive in extreme cold. They can travel together with many other hares, sometimes huddling with dozens or more, but are usually found alone, sometimes taking more than one partner. The Arctic hare can run up to 60 kilometres per hour (40 mph).[3]</blockquote>

<h2>Arctic owl</h2>
<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowy_owl">The snowy owl (Bubo scandiacus),[4] also known as the polar owl, the white owl and the Arctic owl,[5] is a large, white owl of the true owl family.[6] Snowy owls are native to the Arctic regions of both North America and the Palearctic, breeding mostly on the tundra.[2] It has a number of unique adaptations to its habitat and lifestyle, which are quite distinct from other extant owls.[7] One of the largest species of owl, it is the only owl with mainly white plumage.[6] Males tend to be a purer white overall while females tend to more have more extensive flecks of dark brown.[8] Juvenile male snowy owls have dark markings that may appear similar to females until maturity, at which point they typically turn whiter. The composition of brown markings about the wing, although not foolproof, is the most reliable technique to age and sex individual snowy owls.[9]: 48 </blockquote>
